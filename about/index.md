## About me
* Since I had studied Business Management, I felt the pain to find the resources
 because they required a lot of time-consuming and efforts. While I struggled
 searching information, I kept thinking about how to reduce the time and find
 it efficiently. I wonder what if I develop the platform to resolve
 the inconvenience came across my mind. So, I decided to change my major as
 Information System Engineer which learn about Business Management and Computer Science.
 After I had changed my study to programming, I was thrilled that write codes that
 process tasks efficiently with less time-consuming. However, using the information
 from the classes that I took was not enough to build my goal, so I started to learn
 more information by myself. The more I study programming, the more thrill comes to me,
 and I cannot stop learning programming. Even I become appropriate to build a platform
 that makes people's life easier, I will keep studying programming to come up with
 the better program and platform that can be used for all needs.
