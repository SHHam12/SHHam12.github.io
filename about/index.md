## About me
*  I began my studies at Stony Brook University as a Business Management major and was struck by how time-consuming and difficult it was to find the necessary resources and information for my work. While I struggled to search for information, I kept thinking about how to reduce research time and find resources more efficiently. I wondered, what if I developed the platform to resolve these inconvenience. So, I decided to change my major to
 Information System Engineering and specialize in Business Management.
 After I  changed my major, I was thrilled to write my own codes that process tasks efficiently. However, using the information from the classes that I took was not enough to reach my goal, so I started to learn more information independently. The more I study programming, the more thrilling I find it. Even when I build a platform
 that makes people's lives easier; I keep studying to improve my programs so they can meet even more needs.
